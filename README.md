# SVG Logo Maker

A simple Node.js command-line application for generating logos and saving them as SVG files. This tool allows you to create custom logos by selecting a shape, setting the text, and choosing colors.

## User Story

As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application should accept user input for text (up to three characters), text color, shape, and shape color.
- It should generate an SVG file named `logo.svg`.
- The generated SVG should match the user's input for text, shape, and colors.
- The application should use Inquirer for user input and Jest for unit testing.
